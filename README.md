# bikesharing
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to use data to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. We need to analyze the data on bike business from Aug, 2019 to find out the length of time that bikes are checked out of all riders and genders, number of bike trips, the highest usage time in a day. Then we need to put all the these in Tableau for investors to understand easily.

## Results
*a total of 2,344,224 trips in the month of August, 2019.

*About 65% of the bike renters are male.

*Around 8am and 5-7pm is the most popular stop time for all bikers in weekdays. We can assume that customers ride bikes to or from work. 

*Thursday is the most popular day for the subscribers.

## Summary
From the data of bike-sharing business in August, it seems to be a good business to invest. But I think we still need to analyze one of the winter months since the winter weather in NYC might have the huge impact on the bike sharing business.
